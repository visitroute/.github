# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to VisitRoute

**VisitRoute** is a lightweight, privacy-first session & user flow tracking tool.  
You decide exactly what to track â€” nothing is collected by default.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Track only what matters** â€“ define every event via `data-track` HTML attributes or JavaScript.
- **No default tracking** â€“ zero data collection unless you specify it.
- **Privacy-first** â€“ no cookies, no fingerprinting, no third parties.
- **Self-hosted** â€“ keep full control of your data.
- **Fast & lightweight** â€“ optimized for performance.

## ðŸ›  Example

```html
<button data-track="add-to-cart">Buy now</button>
```

That's it â€” VisitRoute will record the interaction in your self-hosted analytics.
